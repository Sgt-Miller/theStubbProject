The Stubb project.
Aim - To make a program which helps the user do tasks quickly.
The bot is expected to reply back. The bot is not and must not try to
imitate human characters. At the end of the day it is a program with mostly hard coded answers.
It should have the capablity to find "mood" based on text/speech analysis.

This is an in house program. Public distribution is not allowed unless otherwise specified.
People who have the source code are not allowed to share/modify without permission.

The program may include a configuration file. Lists are expected to be read at run time. If found to be performance hog, alternate ways could be explored.
